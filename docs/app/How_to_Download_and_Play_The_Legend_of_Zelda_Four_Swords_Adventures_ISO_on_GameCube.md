If you want to relive this amazing game on your GameCube console, you will need a copy of the game disc and a compatible Game Boy Advance cable. However, if you don't have these items or you want to play the game on your PC or mobile device, you can use an ISO file instead. An ISO file is a digital copy of the game disc that you can run on an emulator.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and play The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures ISO on your GameCube or any other device that supports emulation. Follow these simple steps and enjoy this epic adventure with your friends!
 
## Step 1: Download The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures ISO
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the ISO file of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. You can find it on various websites that offer GameCube ROMs or ISOs, such as Vimm's Lair[^1^], Emuparadise[^2^], or Archive.org[^4^]. Make sure you download the file from a reliable source and scan it for viruses before opening it.
 
The size of the ISO file is about 159 MB, so it should not take too long to download. Once you have downloaded the file, you can extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a file with the extension .iso or .ciso or .nkit.iso. This is the file that you will use to play the game on your emulator.
 
## Step 2: Choose an Emulator
 
An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of a console, allowing you to play games that are not compatible with your device. There are many emulators available for different platforms, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, etc. You will need to choose an emulator that supports GameCube games and works well on your device.
 
Some of the most popular GameCube emulators are Dolphin, Gcube, WhineCube, and Dolwin. Dolphin is considered the best GameCube emulator, as it has high compatibility, excellent graphics, and many features. However, it also requires a powerful device to run smoothly. Gcube, WhineCube, and Dolwin are less demanding but also less accurate and stable.
 
Once you have chosen an emulator, you will need to download it from its official website or a trusted source. Then, you will need to install it on your device and configure it according to your preferences. You may need to adjust some settings such as video, audio, input, etc. to optimize the performance and quality of the emulation.
 
## Step 3: Load The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures ISO
 
The final step is to load the ISO file of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures on your emulator. To do this, you will need to launch your emulator and select the option to open or load a file. Then, you will need to browse your device's storage and locate the ISO file that you extracted earlier. Select it and click OK.
 
The game should start running on your emulator and you should see the title screen. You can now play the game using your keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or any other input device that your emulator supports. If you want to play with your friends, you will need to connect multiple Game Boy Advance devices using a link cable or an adapter. Alternatively, you can use another emulator that supports multiplayer emulation over a network.
 
## Conclusion
 
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is a fun and challenging game that you can enjoy alone or with your friends. By using an ISO file and an emulator, you can play this game on any device that you want without needing a physical copy of the game disc or a Game Boy Advance cable
